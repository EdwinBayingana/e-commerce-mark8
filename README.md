## Mark8 Ecommerce Application

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```sh
# The repository link below is not accurate (for anonymity). Instead, use the link of the repository from which you are going through this documentation
git clone https://github.com/ðŸŽ­/e-commerce-mark8.git
cd e-commerce-mark8
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, run:

```sh
npm install
```

### Step 3: Run the website

After installing the dependencies, you can run the application with the following commands:

```bash
# Run the Development server
npm run dev

# Run the Production server
npm start

# Only for building the Production server
npm run build
```

### Step 4: Update the .env file

Remember to replace these values in the .env file as demonstrated in the .env.example file.

## Congratulations!

You've successfully run the Next JS website.

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your browser shortly.
